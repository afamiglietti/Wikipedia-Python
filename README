This Python Script was developed to parse and collect data on a collection of Wikipedia Article for Deletion discussions (AfDs). It should be amenable to other Wikipedia parsing tasks as well, with some modifications. It takes dumps from the Wikipedia Special:Export feature as input. It uses about 40meg of ram to work its way through a 250 meg file... so it may need some memory optimization.
